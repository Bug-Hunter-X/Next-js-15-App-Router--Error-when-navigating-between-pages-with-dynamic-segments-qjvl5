# Next.js 15 App Router Bug: Dynamic Segment Navigation

This repository demonstrates a bug in Next.js 15's App Router when navigating between pages using links containing dynamic segments.  The issue results in unexpected behavior or errors during navigation.

## Bug Description

The bug occurs when using `next/link` to navigate to routes containing dynamic segments.  While simple static links work fine, those with dynamic parts can trigger errors, particularly related to unexpected segment handling or route matching.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate between links. Observe any unexpected behavior.  The error may appear in the console or as a client-side error preventing the navigation.

## Expected Behavior

Smooth and error-free navigation between pages regardless of the presence of dynamic segments in the route.

## Actual Behavior

Navigation fails or displays errors.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring proper route configuration and potentially using a different navigation method, which is demonstrated in the `bugSolution.js` file.
